# A beginners guide to [[Observability]]

With modern DevOps models, developers are taking greater ownership of knowing what’s going on for a better customer experience. To effectively do this, all roles need visibility inside their entire architecture — from infrastructure through applications all the way out to third-party APIs — to fix (and ideally to prevent) problems.

Observability goes beyond mere monitoring (even of very complicated infrastructures) and is instead about building visibility into every layer of your business.

### Observablity What it is and isn't

Simply defined, observability is the ability to answer any question about your business or application, at any time, no matter how complex your infrastructure. How you do this in the application development and operations context is simple — by instrumenting systems and applications to collect metrics, traces and logs, and sending all of this data to a system that can store and analyze it and help you gain insights.

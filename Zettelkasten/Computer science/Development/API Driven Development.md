# API Driven Development

**What is API Driven Development?** 

API Driven Development is a process that allows developers to focus on API design before writing code. The idea is, before you start writing your software, you first design and agree on what the API will be. You focus time up front putting thoughtful design into this API, and the first artifact out of the process is the API design. This API design could be captured in a document, or it could be built out as a Mock API. 

Creating the API before you create the code that backs the API provides benefits to both the developers creating the backend code, as well as the clients who will be consuming the API. 

**Faster Application Development**

Both the backend API Code and Client code can be written in parallel once the API design is created. Integrating and merging the two also becomes easier as the API is the contract upon which they both agreed. If the contract didn't change, the release of the actual backend code should go smoothly.

**APIs encourage modular architectures**

By designing the API up front, you know what functionality should exist in the code and therefore the scope of the program is well defined. This encourages modular and distributed architectures.

**Uncover API Incompatibilities quickly**

By designing and releasing the API first, you are allowing the consumers of the API to discover incompatible integrations quickly, instead of having integration be the last step for release.

**Your App will be ready to connect to the world**

Through hosting your code with an API, you can then integrate it with other systems easily. 

**Documentation**

By following API Driven Development you have already documented the API and its features before you implement it. Tools exist in the market that allow you to visualize your API.

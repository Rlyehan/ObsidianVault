# How to become a Data Engineer

## What is a Data Engineer? 

Data engineers are responsible for laying the foundations for the acquisition, storage, transformation, and management of data in an organization. They manage the design, creation, and maintenance of database architecture and data processing systems; this ensures that the subsequent work of analysis, visualization, and machine learning models development can be carried out seamlessly, continuously, securely, and effectively. In short, data engineers are the most technical profiles in the field of data science, playing a critical bridging role between software and application developers and traditional data science positions. 

Data engineers are responsible for the first stage of the traditional data science workflow: the process of data collection and storage. They ensure that the large volume of data collected from different sources becomes accessible raw material for other data science specialists, such as data analysts and data scientists. On one hand, this entails developing and maintaining scalable data infrastructures with high availability, performance, and capability to integrate new technologies. On the other hand, data engineers are also tasked with monitoring the movement and status of data throughout these systems.
 
## What Does a  Data Engineer do? 

Data engineers are key players in the development and maintenance of the data architecture of any company. They are specialists in preparing large datasets for use by analysts. When an analyst needs to interpret information, the data engineer creates programs and routines to prepare data in a suitable layout.

As a result, the data engineer’s day-to-day runs, fundamentally, between two processes: 

-   ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes include developing data extraction, transformation and loading tasks, and moving data between different environments. 
-   Data Cleaning Processes so that it arrives in a normalized and structured fashion into the hands of analysts and data scientists. 

But the process of data collection and storage can be extremely complex. There may be different data sources involved, and these data sources may have different types of data. As the volume, variety, and velocity of the data at hand increase, so does the complexity of the data engineer’s work. 

To ensure that the tasks performed are timely, robust, and scalable, data engineers develop the so-called data pipelines. A data pipeline moves data into defined stages, one example of which is loading data from an on-premise database to a cloud service. A key feature is that pipelines automate this movement. Instead of asking a data engineer to manually run a program every time new data is created, they could schedule the task to be triggered on an hourly or daily basis, or following a certain event.


## Skills a Data Engineer Needs

Data engineers require a significant set of technical skills to address their highly complex tasks. However, it’s very difficult to make a detailed and comprehensive list of skills and knowledge to succeed in any data engineering role; in the end, the data science ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and new technologies and systems are constantly appearing.  This means that data engineers must be constantly learning to keep pace with technological breakthroughs. 

Notwithstanding this, here is a non-exhaustive list of skills that any data engineer should have:

-   **Database management:** Data engineers spend a considerable part of their daily work operating databases, either to collect, store, transfer, clean, or just consult data. Hence, data engineers must have a good knowledge of database management. This entails being fluent with SQL (Structured Query Language), the basic language to interact with databases, and having expertise with some of the most popular SQL dialects, including MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. In addition to relational databases, data engineers need to be familiar with NoSQL (“Not only SQL”) databases, which are rapidly becoming the go-to systems for Big Data and real-time applications. Therefore, although the number of NoSQL engines is on the rise, data engineers should at least understand the difference between NoSQL database types and the use cases for each of them. If you are confused about NoSQL and how it differs from SQL, our course [NoSQL Concepts](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/nosql-concepts) is a great place to gain clarity.

-   **Programming languages:** As in other data science roles, coding is a mandatory skill for data engineers. Besides SQL, data engineers use other programming languages for a wide range of tasks. There are [many programming languages](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-programming-languages-for-data-scientists-in-2022) that can be used in data engineering, but Python is certainly one of the best options. Python is a lingua franca in data science, and it’s perfect for executing ETL jobs and writing data pipelines. Another reason to use Python is its great integration with tools and frameworks that are critical in data engineering, such as Apache Airflow and Apache Spark. Many of these open-source frameworks run on the Java Virtual Machine. If your company works with these frameworks, you will probably need to learn Java or Scala.

-   **Distributed computing frameworks:** In recent years, distributed systems have become ubiquitous in data science. A distributed system is a computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple computers (also known as a cluster) on a network. Distributed systems split up the work across the cluster, coordinating the efforts to complete the job more efficiently. Distributed computing frameworks, such as [Apache Hadoop](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/tutorial-cloudera-hadoop-tutorial) and [Apache Spark](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/apache-spark-python), are designed for the processing of massive amounts of data, and they provide the foundations for some of the most impressive Big Data applications. Having some expertise in one of these frameworks is a must-have for any aspiring data engineer.

-   **Cloud technology:** Cloud computing is one of the hottest topics in data science. The demand for cloud-based solutions is rapidly changing the landscape. Today, being a data engineer entails, to a great extent, connecting your company’s business systems to cloud-based systems. With the rise of services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud, the whole data workflow can take place within the Cloud. Therefore, a good data engineer must know and have experience in the use of cloud services, their advantages, disadvantages, and their application in Big Data projects. You should at least be familiar with a platform like AWS or Azure, as they are the most widespread.

-   **ETL frameworks:** One of the main roles of data engineers is to create data pipelines with ETL technologies and orchestration frameworks. In this section, we could list many technologies, but the data engineer should know or be comfortable with some of the best known–such as [Apache Airflow](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-airflow-in-python?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaignid=16084198552&utm_adgroupid=&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=&utm_network=x&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=&utm_targetid=&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=1005475&gclid=CjwKCAjwu_mSBhAYEiwA5BBmf0oCCAL9gM3SMyRTp3af_YEsxy6v7GpXHoKTFApfTJOA5iD7ip1-WhoCPHoQAvD_BwE) and Apache NiFi. Airflow is an orchestration framework. It’s an open-source tool for planning, generating, and tracking data pipelines. NiFi is perfect for a basic, repeatable big data ETL process.

-   **Stream Processing frameworks:** Some of the most innovative data science applications use real-time data. As a result, the demand for candidates familiarized in stream processing frameworks is on the rise. That’s why, learning how to use streaming processing tools like Flink, Kafka Streams or Spark Streaming is a smooth move for data engineers willing to take their careers to the next level.

-   **Shell:** Most of the jobs and routines of the Cloud and other Big Data tools and frameworks are executed using shell commands and scripts. Data engineers must be comfortable with the terminal to edit files, run commands, and navigate the system.

-   **Communication skills:** Last but not least, data engineers also need communication skills to work across departments and understand the needs of data analysts and data scientists as well as business leaders. Depending on the organization, data engineers may also need to know how to develop dashboards, reports, and other visualizations to communicate with stakeholders.


## What to Expect in a Data Engineering Interview

Surprisingly, despite the growing demand for data engineers, the resources on what to expect in a data engineering interview and how to prepare for it are still scarce. 

Data engineering interviews are normally broken down into a technical and a non-technical part. In the technical part, recruiters will assess your data engineering skills and your technical suitability for the job. You can expect questions related to four topics: 

-   **Your resume:** Recruiters will want to know your experiences that are related to the data engineering position. Make sure to highlight your previous work in data science positions and projects in your resume and prepare to provide full detail about them, as this information is critical for recruiters to assess your technical skills, as well as your problem-solving, communication, and project management.
-   **Programming:** This is probably the most stressful part of a data science interview. Generally, you will be asked to resolve a problem in a few lines of code within a short time, using Python or a data framework like Spark. For example, your exercise might consist of making a simple data pipeline to load and to clean data.  While the problem should not be very complex, the tension of the moment can negatively affect your performance. If you are not familiar with this kind of test, you could try to practice with some coding questions beforehand.
-   **SQL:** You will not go far in your data engineering career without solid expertise in SQL. That’s why, in addition to the programming test, you may be asked to solve a problem that involves using SQL. Typically, the exercise will consist of writing efficient queries to do some data processing in databases.
-   **System design:** This is the most conceptual part of the technical interview, and probably the most difficult. Designing data architectures is one of the most impactful tasks of data engineers. In this part, you will be asked to design a data solution from end to end, which normally comprises three aspects: data storage, data processing, and data modeling. Given the rapidly growing scope of the data science ecosystems, the options for design are endless. You need to be ready to discuss the pros and cons and the possible trade-offs of your choices.

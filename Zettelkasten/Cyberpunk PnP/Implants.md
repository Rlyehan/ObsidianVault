There are three main categories in what peole call implants:
- mechanical
- biological
- Hybrid

Hybrid implants are by fare the cheapest and most common, ofering a modicum of benefits, with a vast amount of problems. Some examples of hybrid implants are:
 - Corona replacements connected to the nero-Core
 - Extra-glands, supporting digestion
 - External support systems, like certain worker class exosceletons that get bolted directly to the sceleton and are interconnected with the muscle fibers.

While biolocial implants are what people want, mechanical ones are waht people can actually get. 

Biological implants represent are form of pinnacle. While they might not be able to compete with purley mechanical ones in terms of certain otuputs, only the poor would have any actual need for that sort of thing.

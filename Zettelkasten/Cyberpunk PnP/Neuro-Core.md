The Neuro-core, the must ahve in todays ever online society. It's what connects you to teh world outside, at least it is the only connection that matters.

What is a neuro core? Oriiginally the brainchild of XYZ corp, the first implementations of the Neuro-core, then a trademakr product, came to the makred in the mid 2030ies, a simplz neural interface that allow people to interact with computers withoyut the need of pesky hands and abstaraction layers.

What is a neuro-core now? While XYZ is long gone, and there no longer is a singular neuro-core, each mega-corp has their own flavor, well mutliple flavours depending on how well connected and how deep you r pocekts are, the term stuck arround to describe our modern version of this neural interfaces. 

Now they serve as the CPU of your body, connecting everython together.

Different forms:
 - simple neuro-chip implanted at the base of the skull
 - a more extensive implant that replaces parts of the brain-stem, who needs primal instints anyways?
 - A massive net interconneted with your brains surface, allowing for much more preciese control and a far deeper connection.
 - A highly expensive mix of nanomachienes that build update and repair the deep connection with your brain, allowing not only to be an interface to act from the brain, but also the otehr way arround.

The more intrusve the version the more impact it has on you, unless you have the money to start early. Everyone while receive the most basci version of a neuro-chip, to not have one is illigal and punished by imideat disposal. 

Higher version of the implant are needed for certain interactions and to enable the use of things like deep-dive VR, or the integration of your own personal assitant AI.

There are many different forms that they are implementet, for example with a multi chip mesh, having seperate chips responsible for different bodily function to allow more precise, faster and independet control, coommonly used insolders to keep a modicum of control over their limbs should they have perished.

# SQL Intro

Language used to issue commands and instcutions to the DBMS. 

**DDL**: Data Definition language

We use SQL here to define schemata, so waht columns and column types a table should have.
We also define constraints to restrict admissible content, like constraints on single relations or constraints on multiple relations.

**Integrity Constraints** constrainst tha limit the admissible content of tables. The DBMS enforeces ingerity constraints.

**Foreign Key constraint**: A foreign key constraint links two tables. Identifies a set of foreign key columns in table 1 and maps them to the primary key column in table 2. The foreign key values must appear as a primary key, as they map each row in table 1 to a row in table 2.

**DML**: Data Manipulation Language

We use SQL here to insert, delete, update and analyze the data in our tables.

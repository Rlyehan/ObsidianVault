# CI/CD

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD, a part of DevOps, is a method that allows us to frequently deliver apps, generally by making use of automation throughout the lifecycle and by prioritizing releasability over the creation of new features.

The CI/CD process consist of the CI part, [[continuous integration]], and the CD part, either [[continuous delivery]] or [[continuous deployment]],  and all the mechanisms that support them, [[continuous testing]] beeing the key parts for us.

##  CI/CD @ BI

BI has EDP, a full DevOps platform, that teams can access to enable them with DevOps tools and automations. It goes beyond what we have mentioned here, covering all the stages of DevOps. You can think of it as a platform that takes the example from above and extends it with some extra features, like integration with Jira and the generation of needed documents. And it does so without you having to to any of the heavy lifting beyond what you need to to for your project anyways. It has been designed to support teams of any kind, wether you are developing an in-house solution or working with COTS, GxP or not, and much more. It is higly encouraged by us to get yourself familiar with this paltform, to to so go here (link to EDP introduction).

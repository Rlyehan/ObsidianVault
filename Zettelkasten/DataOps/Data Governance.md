## The difference between data quality and data governance

[Data quality](https://www.collibra.com/us/en/blog/what-is-data-quality) describes the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and other attributes of data. Organizations need high-quality data that they can trust to make critical decisions. Without high-quality data, organizations cannot become data-driven because they cannot trust their data. The lack of trust hinders the organizations to use their data to make impactful business decisions, leading to inefficiency, missed opportunities, and ultimately, financial loss. 

Data governance is a collection of practices and processes to standardize and automate the management and use of data within an organization. it is a system of authority and control over the management of organizational data assets. Data governance provides a framework for collaboration through a shared language. Teammates within and across departments can communicate using the same terminology and analyze the same data. Additionally, clarifying roles and responsibilities eliminates confusion to make data processes and collaboration easy to follow.

Organizations use data governance for a number of reasons. Data governance impacts security, privacy, accuracy, compliance, roles and responsibilities, management, integration, and more. Organizations use data governance to

-   Increase transparency around data, its use, its availability, and its management
-   Standardize data systems, policies, and procedures
-   Resolve data issues
-   Ensure regulatory and organizational compliance

All of these tasks are directly required for improving and monitoring data quality. Good data governance brings data creators and data users on the same platform, enabling communication and shared understanding about data quality.

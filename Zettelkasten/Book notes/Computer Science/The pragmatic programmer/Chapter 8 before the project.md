# Chapter 8 before the project
>Even though the agile manifesto begins with "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools," virtaully all "agile" projects begin with an ironic discussion of which process and witch tools they use.

**The requirements pit**

>No One knows exactly what they want

**The requirements myth**

>In that world, exact specifications of anything are rare, if not downright impossible.

**programming as therapy**

>In our experience, this initial statement of need is not an absolute requriement. The client may not realize this, but it is really an invitation to explore.

>When given something that seems simple, we annoy people by looking for edge cases and asking about them.

>In those cases pragmatic programmers rely on the "is this waht you meant?" feedback.

>Implement the gernal case, with the policy information as an example of the type of thing the system needs to support.

**Requirements documents are for planing**

>You might think that a single index card can't hold the information needed to implement a component of th eapplication. You'd be right.

>THe simplest statement that accurately reflects the business need is best.

>Requirements are need.

>THey see another story card go up on the board, and they'll get to help choose anotehr card to move into the next interation to make room. Feedback works both ways.

### Solving impossible puzzles

>If the box is the boundary of constraints and conditions, then the trick is to find the box, which may be consierably larger tahn you think.


### Working together

**Mob programming**

>You might think of mob programming as thight collaboration with live coding.


### The essence of agility
>WE see teams and companies eager for off-the-shelf solutions: Agile-in-a-box. And we see many consultants and companies all to happy to sell them what they want.

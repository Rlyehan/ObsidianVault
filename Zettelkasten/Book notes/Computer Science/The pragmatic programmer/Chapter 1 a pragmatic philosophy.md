# Chapter 1 a pragmatic philosophy

### Take responsibility

>When you do accept the responsibilty for an outcome, you hsould expect to be held accountable for it. WHen you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in jidgment, admit int honestly and try to offer options

### Software Entropy

>Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poro code) unrepaired


### Big Picture

>Get in the habit of really looking and noticing you rsurroundings. Do the same for your project.



### Good enough software

>But artist will tell you that all the hard work is ruined if you don't know when to stop.

### Documentation

>Pragmatic programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process.

>Commenting source code gives you the perfect opportunity to document those elusive bits of a project taht can't be documented anywhere else; engineeering trade-offs, why decisions where made, what other alternatives where discarded, and so on.

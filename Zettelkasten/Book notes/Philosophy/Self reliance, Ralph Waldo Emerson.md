# Self reliance, Ralph Waldo Emerson
>Familiar as the voice of teh mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages.

>Scoicety is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for better securing of his bread to each stakeholder, to surrender the liberty and culture fo the eater.

>Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.

>No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readlily transferable to that or this; the only riht is what is after my constitution, the only wrong that is agaisnt it.

>Few and mean  as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any second testimony.

>The other terror taht scares us from self-trust is consistency.

>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philisophers and divines.

>The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks.

>But man postpones or remembers; he deos not live in the rpesent, but with reverted eye lements the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future.

>At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles.

>If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined.

I believe that the core messages in this essay are quite important, even still in our modern society, mayhaps even more so than to the times of Ralph Waldo Emerson, But I also think that the way he argues we should go about them instead is clerly going from one expterm to the other, going from comformitity to a scociety of one, disrecarding anything and everything that is inoportune for me.

But that still does not change that the main points regardaing conformity, living in the past, and foolish consistency are not valuable points of crtitic.
